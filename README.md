   > Follow provided instructions if needed

> [!TIP]
> Edit `settings.yaml` according to your needs, you can view schema in
> [config_schema.py](src/config_schema.py) and in [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml)

**Set up PyCharm integrations**

1. Run configurations ([docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-debug-configuration.html#createExplicitly)).
   Right-click the `__main__.py` file in the project explorer, select `Run '__main__'` from the context menu.
2. Ruff ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff)).
   It will lint and format your code. Make sure to enable `Use ruff format` option in plugin settings.
3. Pydantic ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12861-pydantic)). It will fix PyCharm issues with
   type-hinting.
4. Conventional commits ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit)). It will help you
   to write [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Deployment

We use Docker with Docker Compose plugin to run the service on servers.

1. Copy the file with settings: `cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml`
2. Change settings in the `settings.yaml` file according to your needs
   (check [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml) for more info)
3. Install Docker with Docker Compose
4. Build a Docker image: `docker compose build --pull`
5. Run the container: `docker compose up --detach`
6. Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`

# How to update dependencies

## Project dependencies

1. Run `poetry update` to update all dependencies
2. Run `poetry show --outdated` to check for outdated dependencies
3. Run `poetry add <package>@latest` to add a new dependency if needed

## Pre-commit hooks

1. Run `poetry run pre-commit autoupdate`

Also, Dependabot will help you to keep your dependencies up-to-date, see [dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml).
