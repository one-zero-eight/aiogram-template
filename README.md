## Development

### Getting started

1. Install [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
3. Install project dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#options-2).
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
4. Set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks:

   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
   ```
5. Set up project settings file (check [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml) for more info).
   ```bash
   cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
   ```
   Edit `settings.yaml` according to your needs.

**Set up PyCharm integrations**

1. Ruff ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff)).
   It will lint and format your code. Make sure to enable `Use ruff format` option in plugin settings.
2. Pydantic ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12861-pydantic)). It will fix PyCharm issues with
   type-hinting.
3. Conventional commits ([plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit)). It will help you
   to write [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Run for development

1. Run the database if you have not done it yet
2. Run the Redis server if needed:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d redis
   ```
3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m src.bot
   ```

### Deployment

We use Docker with Docker Compose plugin to run the service on servers.

1. Copy the file with settings: `cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml`
2. Change settings in the `settings.yaml` file according to your needs
   (check [settings.schema.yaml](settings.schema.yaml) for more info)
3. Install Docker with Docker Compose
4. Build a Docker image: `docker compose build --pull`
5. Run the container: `docker compose up --detach`
6. Check the logs: `docker compose logs -f`

# How to update dependencies

## Project dependencies

1. Run `poetry update` to update all dependencies
2. Run `poetry show --outdated` to check for outdated dependencies
3. Run `poetry add <package>@latest` to add a new dependency if needed

## Pre-commit hooks

1. Run `poetry run pre-commit autoupdate`
